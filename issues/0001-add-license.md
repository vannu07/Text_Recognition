# Issue 0001: Add LICENSE file

Status: Closed — added `LICENSE` (MIT) to repository.

Description:
The repository did not include a license. Adding an explicit license helps contributors know how the code can be used.

What I changed:
- Added `LICENSE` (MIT) credited to Shalini Singh.
- Updated `README.md` to reference the license and maintainer.

How to verify:
1. Check that `LICENSE` exists in repository root.
2. Open `README.md` to see license badge and maintainer reference.
